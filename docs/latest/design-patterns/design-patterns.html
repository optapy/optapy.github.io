<p><strong>Determine which relationships (or fields) change during planning and color them orange.</strong> One side of these relationships will become a planning variable later on. For example, in employee rostering, the <code>Shift</code> to <code>Employee</code> relationship changes during planning, so it is orange. However, other relationships, such as from <code>Employee</code> to <code>Skill</code>, are immutable during planning
because Optaplanner cannot assign an extra skill to an employee.</p>

<p>In some cases, multiple planning entity instances have the same set of problem properties. In such cases, it can be useful to create an extra problem property to distinguish them.

<p><strong>Choose the model in which the number of planning entities is fixed during planning</strong>.

On the other hand, the number of employees per shift is known in advance,
so it is better to make the <code>Shift</code> relationship a problem property

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dealing with time and dates in planning problems may be problematic because it is dependent on the needs of your use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several representations of timestamps, dates, durations and periods in Python.
Choose the right representation type for your use case:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>datetime.date</code>, <code>datetime.datetime</code>, &#8230;&#8203;: an accurate way to represent and calculate with timestamps, dates, &#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Supports timezones and DST (Daylight Saving Time).</p>

</ul>

<p><code>int</code>: Caches a timestamp as a simplified number of coarse-grained time units (such as minutes) from the start of the global planning time window or the epoch.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example: a <code>datetime.datetime</code> of <code>1-JAN 08:00:00</code> becomes an <code>int</code> of <code>400</code> minutes. Similarly <code>1-JAN 09:00:00</code> becomes <code>460</code> minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It often represents an extra field in a class, alongside the <code>datetime.datetime</code> field from which it was calculated. The <code>datetime.datetime</code> is used for user visualization, but the <code>int</code> is used in the score constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is faster in calculations, which is especially useful in the TimeGrain pattern.</p>

<li>
<p>Do not use if timezones or DST affect the score constraints.</p>

<p>There are also several designs for assigning a planning entity to a starting time (or date):</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the starting time is fixed beforehand, it is not a planning variable (in that solver).

<h3 id="timeslotPattern"><a class="anchor" href="#timeslotPattern"></a>3.1. Timeslot pattern:  assign to a fixed-length timeslot</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If all planning entities have <strong>the same duration</strong> (or can be inflated to the same duration), the Timeslot pattern is useful.
The planning entities are assigned to a timeslot rather than time.
For example in course timetabling, all lectures take one hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The timeslots can start at any time.
For example, the timeslots start at 8:00, 9:00, 10:15 (after a 15-minute break), 11:15, &#8230;&#8203; They can even overlap, but that is unusual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also usable if all planning entities can be inflated to the same duration.
For example in exam timetabling, some exams take 90 minutes and others 120 minutes, but all timeslots are 120 minutes.
When an exam of 90 minutes is assigned to a timeslot, for the remaining 30 minutes, its seats are occupied too and cannot be used by another exam.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually there is a second planning variable, for example the room.
In course timetabling, two lectures are in conflict if they share the same room at the same timeslot.
However, in exam timetabling, that is allowed, if there is enough seating capacity in the room (although mixed exam durations in the same room do inflict a soft score penalty).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="timeGrainPattern"><a class="anchor" href="#timeGrainPattern"></a>3.2. TimeGrain pattern: assign to a starting TimeGrain</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assigning humans to start a meeting at four seconds after 9 o&#8217;clock is pointless because most human activities have a time granularity of five minutes or 15 minutes.
Therefore it is not necessary to allow a planning entity to be assigned subsecond, second or even one minute accuracy.
The five minute or 15 minutes accuracy suffices.
The TimeGrain pattern models such <strong>time accuracy</strong> by partitioning time as time grains.
For example in meeting scheduling, all meetings start/end in hour, half hour, or 15-minute intervals before or after each hour, therefore the optimal settings for time grains is 15 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each planning entity is assigned to a start time grain.
The end time grain is calculated by adding the duration in grains to the starting time grain.
Overlap of two entities is determined by comparing their start and end time grains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This pattern also works well with a coarser time granularity (such as days, half days, hours, &#8230;&#8203;).
With a finer time granularity (such as seconds, milliseconds, &#8230;&#8203;) and a long time window, the value range (and therefore <a href="../optimization-algorithms/optimization-algorithms.html#searchSpaceSize" class="xref page">the search space</a>) can become too high, which reduces efficiency and scalability.
However, such a solution is not impossible, as shown in cheap time scheduling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="chainedThroughTimePattern"><a class="anchor" href="#chainedThroughTimePattern"></a>3.3. Chained through time pattern: assign in a chain that determines starting time</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a person or a machine continuously works on <strong>one task at a time in sequence</strong>,
which means starting a task when the previous is finished (or with a deterministic delay), the Chained Through Time pattern is useful.
For example, in the vehicle routing with time windows example, a vehicle drives from customer to customer (thus it handles one customer at a time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this pattern, the planning entities are <a href="../planner-configuration/planner-configuration.html#chainedPlanningVariable" class="xref page">chained</a>.
The anchor determines the starting time of its first planning entity.
The second entity&#8217;s starting time is calculated based on the starting time and duration of the first entity.
For example, in task assignment, Beth (the anchor) starts working at 8:00, thus her first task starts at 8:00.
It lasts 52 minutes, therefore her second task starts at 8:52.
The starting time of an entity is usually <a href="../shadow-variable/shadow-variable.html#shadowVariable" class="xref page">a shadow variable</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An anchor has only one chain.
Although it is possible to split up the anchor into two separate anchors, for example split up Beth into Beth&#8217;s left hand and Beth&#8217;s right hand (because she can do two tasks at the same time), this model makes pooling resources difficult.
Consequently, using this model in the exam scheduling example to allow two or more exams to use the same room at the same time is problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between planning entities, there are three ways to create gaps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No gaps: This is common when the anchor is a machine. For example, a build server always starts the next job when the previous finishes, without a break.</p>
</li>

<p>A deterministic gap can be subjected to complex business logic. For example in vehicle routing, a cross-continent truck driver needs to rest 15 minutes after two hours of driving (which may also occur during loading or unloading time at a customer location) and also needs to rest 10 hours after 14 hours of work.</p>

<p>Planning variable gaps: This is uncommon, because that extra planning variable reduces efficiency and scalability,

<p>In some use case there is an overhead time for certain tasks,
which can be shared by multiple tasks, of those are consecutively scheduled.
Basically, the solver receives a <em>discount</em> if it combines those tasks.</p>

<p>For example when delivering pizza to two different customers,
a food delivery service combines both deliveries into a single trip,
if those two customers ordered from the same restaurant around the same time and live in the same part of the city.</p>

<h3 id="timeBucketPattern"><a class="anchor" href="#timeBucketPattern"></a>3.4. Time bucket pattern: assign to a capacitated bucket per time period</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this pattern, the time of each employee is divided into <em>buckets</em>.
For example 1 bucket per week.
Each bucket has a capacity, depending on the FTE (Full Time Equivalent), holidays and the approved vacation of the employee.
For example, a bucket usually has 40 hours for a full time employee and 20 hours for a half time employee
but only 8 hours on a specific week if the employee takes vacation the rest of that week.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each task is assigned to a bucket, which determines the employee and the coarse-grained time period for working on it.
<em>The tasks within one bucket are not ordered</em>: it&#8217;s up to the employee to decide the order.
This gives the employee more autonomy, but makes it harder to do certain optimization,
such as minimize travel time between task locations.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Batch planning</strong>:
Typically runs at night for hours to solve each tenant&#8217;s dataset
and deliver each schedule for the upcoming day(s) or week(s).
Only the final best solution is sent back to the client.
This is a good fit for a serverless cloud architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time planning</strong>:
Typically runs during the day,
to handle unexpected problem changes as they occur in real-time
and sends best solutions as they are discovered to the client.</p>
